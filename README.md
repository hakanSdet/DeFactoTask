# DeFactoTask

This is a task prepared by Hakan KAHRAMAN for DeFacto

On bussines layer, I used gherkin language inside Cucumber BDD

On implementation layer, Java is my programming language, in some methods used JScript 

I used maven as my built magement tool which has pom.xml is brain of maven, manage dependecies and plugins

Resource Directory - Feature Package

I used TC with using Gherkin language inside this folder
Feature file contains Scenarios or Scenario Outlines.
Each Scenario consists of test steps which has Given, When, Then.

Step Definition Package

For each steps, I implemented step definition by using annotations methods so that phrases turned into actions here
I also creating one special Hook class which includes @Before @After annotations and runs before or after each features
I create one object from that page inside step definitions
So that I can be able to use that class features

Pages

To create object form pages, I implemented Page Object Model Design and created classes for each page under pages package.
In this pages folder, I am using PageFactory class to create web elements
I located elements once and use them all the time
I wrote the methods inside by using java and JS 

Runners

I trigger my framework from my runner class
When test is failed, FailedTest runner run automatically 
By using plugin attribute, I created html report. By using Maven verify can create Cucumber html report.

Target

All default html or maven cucumber reports are stored here.
And Screenshots for failed test cases are included automatically in the report.

Utilites

I stored my reusable code here.
I have Browser, Driver, Configuration Reader in utilities class
I have Configuration.properties file and I wrote some datas like url, browser type inside so that I centralize my datas
Beside that I have one Driver class which I created base on singleton design.
Driver class choose driver base on this file and use it for each test cases instead of creating new one for each and is designed available for parallel testing.
     

Tools

Java 8, Selenium 4, TestNg 7(For Assertion),Junit 5 Cucumber 5, BDD, Gherkin, Singleton Driver(available parallel testing),Log4j.
